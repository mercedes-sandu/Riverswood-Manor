Aesthetic goals:
- Have a mysterious atmosphere that intrigues the character to keep playing
- Have puzzles that are engaging, but not too easy or challenging, to provide both tension and relief for the player

Signs of success:
- The player does not give up at any point in the game
- The player doesn't complete the game very quickly

Signs of failure:
- The player is bored and gives up
- The player feels no sense of urgency to complete the game

Core loop:
- Discover a clue, look around the room, act upon that clue
- Allows the player to feel like they are progressing in solving the overall puzzle

Postmortem:
Despite having never made a complete 3D game in Unity before, I think this went surprisingly smoothly! I had a lot of fun with finding models and creating the play area.
None of the scripts were particularly challenging aside from the player controller and interaction, which was a plus! If I had more time, I would've liked to implement
more sounds such as player footsteps, and maybe even some voice acting for the notes. However, I still think I was able to get everything done that I had initially
imagined when designing the game. I learned a lot about 3D development and how much more difficult it can be than 2D development, but I am very proud of the final product!
